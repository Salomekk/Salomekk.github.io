<h1> Movies out of your Dreams </h1>
<h2>“We are so dismissive about dreams. It’s a huge issue. It’s kind of like pretending the moon doesn’t exist.”</h2>

    <b>In the 1991 apocalyptic sci-fi film Until the End of the World, director Wim Wenders creates a vision of the future that, in a few ways, manages to mirror aspects of life in 2019. In the film, a virtual reality (VR) headset-like device is developed that gives blind people a form of sight. But as the film goes on, the device is transformed into a tool that records dreams, and a darker side of humanity comes to light: People become addicted to their subconscious storylines, spending all their time sleeping and waking only to watch their dreams.</b>
</p>
<p class="container">
    <b>The device looks nearly identical to an Oculus headset, but there are more similarities between our current reality and Wenders’ 30-year-old fantasy than that alone. Today, a team of researchers from universities across the country is working on a project dedicated to figuring out how to recreate our nighttime lives on the screen. And like Until the End of the World, it’s unclear what this technology might be used for.
        The as-of-yet-unnamed project is the brainchild of independent dream researcher Daniel Oldis and represents a continuation of a question he and others in his field began exploring decades ago: Are dreams learning experiences, and can behaviors in waking life be influenced by what people dream about? Oldis and others concluded that the answer must be yes based on one key point: When people dream, their bodies move and react. </b>

   <b>“Your eyes, the muscles in your body, it’s just like you’re awake. You’re responding to the dream story,” Oldis says. “Like in waking life, the body is learning from different experiences. We learn from dreams, and it affects our personality.”
       The debate over whether dreams have meaning is a contentious topic among psychologists and neurologists and has been for decades. While some experts believe that dreams are simply the result of neurons in the brain firing at random, other researchers believe that dreams hold deep meaning for our lives and are even linked to our overall health. There’s some evidence to back up the argument. Studies have found that dreaming helps us process emotions, turn our short-term memories to long-term ones, and potentially ward off depression.</b>

<h3>“If you put that all together, what you have is a movie..” </h3>

        <b>In the tradition of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, some psychologists today still use dreams in therapy to help people better understand themselves and their psyches. Rubin Naiman, PhD, is one such psychologist. A sleep and dream expert with the University of Arizona’s Center for Integrative Medicine, Naiman not only advocates for the power of dreams but also believes society is in the midst of an “epidemic of dream loss,” spurred on by the collective brush-off our culture has given to these nightly visions.
            “We are so dismissive about dreams,” he says. “It’s a huge issue. It’s kind of like pretending the moon doesn’t exist.”</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>In the 1970s, Oldis was involved in early dream research that focused on whether dreams had an effect on our waking lives. It was at this time when researchers discovered that people bodies move while they dream. While this was important information, it became newly relevant to Oldis in 2014, when he read about researchers in Japan who were capturing images from dreams using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). That got him thinking: Why not also record their movements? And while you’re at it, why not speech as well?
            “If you put that all together, what you have is a movie,” Oldis says.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>That became his new research question: Can dreams be turned into watchable movies? This led Oldis to partner with the University of Texas at Austin’s Cognitive Neuroscience Lab in 2017 to track the motor behavior of a dreamer. By using an electromyogram (EGM) to measure nerve impulses to the muscles, the researchers successfully recorded the movements of a subject’s dreams, which Oldis turned into a walking avatar that he presented at the International Association for the Study of Dreams in 2017 — the first step to making a dream movie.
        “This is like the early years of the space race,” he says. “But in this case, we’re going into the dream space.”</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Oldis has also done some early work around recording dream speech. By attaching electrodes to a sleeper’s speech muscles, he was able to pick up some elements of their dream dialogues, though full sentences and meanings could not be deciphered. He plans to run another experiment at the University of Texas at Austin this fall that he hopes will result in complete speech readings.
            In addition to conducting those experiments, Oldis has compiled a team of nearly two dozen dream researchers, neurobiologists, sleep scientists, and psychologists (which he calls “the dream team”) from academic institutions and organizations across the country — including the UCLA School of Medicine, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, and more — to put all the components together and create the first dream movie. Next summer, the team will take over a recording studio in Burbank, California. They’ll bring in a mobile MRI and attempt to record the movement, speech, and images from the full dreams of three or four sleeping subjects.</b>
